## What is the NFDI4Microbiota Knowledge Base

This knowledge base is a collection of documents and references important to the [NFDI4Microbiota](https://nfdi4microbiota.de/) consortium. It is also a collection of internal and external knowledge we wish to share with the Microbiota research community, and we welcome any contributions by them.

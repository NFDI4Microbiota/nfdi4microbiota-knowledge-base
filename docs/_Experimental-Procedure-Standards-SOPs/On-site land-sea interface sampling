Field Protocol (one whole day of sampling) 
Site Selection (fill out -> Site Description Form)
Arrive at or before high tide and just before sunrise (if applicable)
Check tidal charts ahead of time and check with local collaborators
Devise a sampling plan at institutional briefing based on tides
Aim to sample: water in outgoing tide, sediment at low tide, soil throughout the day
Locate GPS coordinates previously chosen (using handheld GPS device + provided maps)
Take flags and markers but leave rest of the sampling supplies with vehicles
Explore the site to identify if it is a suitable sampling site 
Set a meeting place
Split into groups of two: Sediment/water samplers and Soil samplers
Sediment/water team: Check coastline for accessibility, safety and that the sediment is able to be sampled
Soil team:Perform plan tour by walking the area in a systematic manner,Look for areas where 20-40m, homogeneous transects would be plausible 
Max. time for site exploration is 45 minutes
Return to meeting place
Discuss and identify soil and sediment transects following the Transect Selection Protocol (section II) 
If suitable transects cannot be identified than adjust site location
Site must be within 500m (on either side) of previously chosen sites
Max. width of site is 200m  
Max. time for picking new site: 1 hour

Transect Selection
Four transects (1x sediment + 3x soil) must be selected using the following spacial criteria 
Transects must be at least 20m wide (max. 40m) with 10m spacing possible (max. 20m) between each square (with square 2 being in the middle of the 20 / 40m)
Sediment transect must be possible in subtidal/intertidal zone
Identify intertidal zone
Look at the sediment type
Muddy and silty sediment preferred 
Sandy and rocky sediments should be chosen only as a last option 
Look for macroalgae typical of intertidal zone (ex Brown algae: Fucus vesiculosus in NW atlantic)
Look for water line
Look for recently deposited debris (e.g. driftwood, rubbish, etc.)
At low tide try to move at least 1-10 m from shoreline depending on the safety conditions at the site
1st soil transect: Stay within 10-50m from shoreline 
2nd soil transect: 50-150m from shoreline
3rd soil transect: 200-300m from shoreline 
The transect homogeneity must be evaluated using the following criteria: 
Vegetation similarity
Litter similarity 
Elevation similarity (peaks or valleys)
Minimal hotspots (fallen trunks, piles of organic litter) 
Minimal tracks (vehicles, humans, general compaction) 
Transect can be safely accessed
If transects are possible continue to Transect Analysis, if not return to Site Selection section
Take pictures of sites (fill out -> Site Imagery Description Form)
Mark chosen transect areas with provided poles and flags
Record coordinates with handheld GPS
Take picture with poles, flags and whiteboard with sample / replicate name written on it

Aerosoles (fill out -> Aerosols Sample Description Form)
Once transects are finalized, aerosol samplers can be set up
Setup and start AIRQUALIFIER EDM 264 at the in center of site away from people or structures (THE BATTERY HAS TO BE CARRIED BY AT LEAST 2 PERSONS)
An SASS 3100 aerosol sampler should be set up at each (soil) transect at the same time
To minimize human exposure, the samplers should also be placed between the first and second square of each soil transect
If topography of any of the transects does not support this, move all samplers to between the second and third square of each soil transect
Assemble the air sampling equipment (report serial # of sampler on log-sheet)
Mount the SASS 3100s on a camera tripod so that they sit upright with the air inlet facing up 
Make sure the tripod and the sampler are steady
Stretch out all joints of the tripod and lock them by turning into the “lock” position
Push the “Benro” lock into place to prevent the legs from moving
Assemble the mounting part so the joints are tight
When all stretched out, the height to the top of the tripod from the ground should be about 144 cm                                                                                
Make sure that the temperature/humidity device is on and not placed close to sources which could disrupt the measurements (e.g. heaters, fans, etc.).
Clean the air inlet of the SASS 3100
Put on a new pair of gloves
Use an alcohol wipe or a tissue with 70% ethanol
Wipe carefully (dab, don’t rub) if you use a tissue so that the tissue doesn’t disintegrate and leave bits all over the air inlet
Let the air inlet air dry (approximately 2 min)
Prepare the negative control filter on the SASS 3100 (report serial and lot # on the log-sheet)
Carefully open the filter pouch 
Touching only the filter frame, take the filter out of the bag 
Do not touch the filter with your hands, as it is sterile!
Mount it onto the air inlet                                                                                                     
With gloves, take the filters off the sampler by only touching the frame
While holding the filter frame, gently push the filter in one corner using clean tweezers. Grab the filter with the tweezers and place it in a pre-labeled small Whirl-Pak (0.5 L)
Push very carefully to avoid that the filter falls on the ground
Freeze the negative control filter in liquid nitrogen and store it in a cardboard box in a dry shipper until it arrives at the laboratory
Prepare the sample filter on the SASS 3100 (report serial and lot # on the log-sheet)
Carefully open a new filter pouch 
Touching only the filter frame, take the filter out of the bag 
Do not touch the filter with your hands, as it is sterile!
Mount it onto the air inlet
Add the dust/rain covers to the SASS 3100s by sliding it in and clicking it into place
Start the SASS 3100 sampler 
Flip the ON/OFF switch all the way over from OFF to ON (make sure not to end up in the middle position) 
Walk away immediately (to avoid sampling human material) 
Set an alarm for 4 hours (ideally by 2-3 samplers so that it is not forgotten)
After 4 hours turn the sampler off by flipping the ON/OFF switch all the way over to the OFF position (all three samplers should be switched off simultaneously by three samplers)
Recover sampling filter
Take the dust/rain covers off the samplers
With gloves, take the filters off the sampler by only touching the frame
While holding the filter frame, gently push the filter in one corner using clean tweezers. Grab the filter with the tweezers and place it in a pre-labeled small Whirl-Pak (0.5 L)
Push very carefully to avoid that the filter falls on the ground
Freeze the sample filter in liquid nitrogen and store it in a cardboard box in a dry shipper until it arrives at the laboratory
Take the SASS 3100 air sampler off the tripod and clean 
Wipe with dH2O to prevent corrosion and salt accumulation
Using an alcohol wipe or a tissue with 70% ethanol 
Wipe carefully (dab, don’t rub) if you use a tissue so that the tissue doesn’t disintegrate and leave bits all over the air inlet
Let the air inlet air dry (approximately 2 min)
Take the battery out of the sampler and charge it overnight at the institute
Store the sampler in its Pelican case (whenever not in use)
Disassemble the tripod and store it in its bags. The folded up tripod should look like this in order to fit in the bag   

Shallow waters (fill out -> Shallow Water Sample Description Form)
Important Note
This section only covers the site selection, sampling and initial filtration of shallow water near the shoreline, but not the entire shallow water processing, which will be done at the processing van. For the detailed protocol, see the “Handbook of operations and protocol for shallow water (SW) for TREC”
Choosing the sampling site
The site for sampling of the shallow water should be aligned with the transects selected previously (if possible), but may be shifted depending on the conditions at the site, especially regarding safety measures
Site specific sampling strategy should be discussed beforehand i.e. bucket vs niskin bottle, rope vs entering the water
The exact location for sampling has to be decided based on the following criteria (in order of importance):
SECURITY
Depth at the sampling site between 50 cm and 1m deep
Minimal potential sediment resuspension by the samplers
Minimal natural sediment resuspension (e.g. waves, currents, …)
Sampling
Once the sampling location has been decided, set up the CTD:
Assemble the CTD, the floating platform and the mooring line
Turn on the CTD by turning clockwise the red cap
Moor the CTD in close vicinity to the sampling point.
<!> If there is current, place the CTD upstream of the sampling point in order to avoid the resuspended sediment due to sampling to pollute the CTD acquisition.
Before proper sampling, make FSW using the portable filtration device (Katadyn Hiker Pro).
Plunge the inlet in sea water and connect the outlet to a cleaned washing bottle
Fill the two washing bottles 
<!> Pay attention not to contaminate FSW with drops coming from your hands and/or the filtration device
Sampling using the 5L Niskin bottle
<!> Avoid as much as possible the contamination with artificially resuspended sediments by staying downstream of the Niskin. Minimise stepping in the sampling area
<i> If the conditions are not met for Niskin sampling (e.g. water too shallow, outgoing tide….) use a 10L bucket (degraded mode)
Place the Niskin with both sides open at sub-surface (~20-30 cm deep).
Let some water flow through the Niskin to rinse it (especially for the first water collection).
Pour ~1L of the filtered Niskin content to each of the carboys to rinse them. Use the series of 200µm and 20µm sieve and the funnels to keep only the <20µm size fraction. To speed up the process use the bottom Niskin lid instead of the Niskin spigot. Open the lid gently to control the flow.
<!> Pay attention to not let water overflow the sieve
Close the carboys lids, shake and empty them. Repeat this rinsing operation a second time.
After rinsing, clean the sieve in the water to remove all particulate matter by dipping them in the water and quickly washing them with FSW.
Fill all the carboys to 10L by repeating twice the Niskin sampling and the transfer into the carboys using the 200µm and the 20µm.
The last two filled carboys are the ones dedicated to MetaBGT.
For each Carboy, recover the 20-200µm size fraction. Concentrate the particles collected on the sieve on one side using the washing bottle (filled on site manually with freshly on-site FSW). Poor the particles to the dedicated 20-200µm 200 nmL bottles. Complete the bottle to 200 mL using the washing bottle.
Fill a last Niskin bottle to be brought back to the van lab
Recover the CTD probe and stop the acquisition.
Bring the 4 x 10L carboys, 4 x 200 mL 20-200 µm bottle and the Niskin to the van lab for processing.

Unpack prelabeled tubes and bags
Barcodes of each sample taken should be added to the checklist / log-sheet on the Sediment Sample Distribution form after samples are taken
Prepare and follow the TREC field safety guide (check surroundings, safety equipment like manual life jackets, dry suits, ropes, bodyboard, packraft etc.) 
Transect Analysis (fill in -> Sediment Transect Description Form)

Sediment transect must be possible in subtidal/intertidal zone
At low tide try to move at least 1-10 m from shoreline depending on the safety conditions at the site
Using a field tape, measure off 40 meters (decrease down to 20 or 10 meters if necessary)
Mark each end of the transect with a pole and flag

End of day clean up
After returning to the institute -> unpack and clean the equipment 
Clean up the auger, sampling trays and bucket as follows:
Clean with DiWater making sure to remove all visible dirt 
Dry with ChemWipes
Rinse with ethanol from wash bottle 
Place on a clean towel and leave to dry for 1-2 min
Ensure that equipment is free of paper residues
Place auger heads in clean sampling bag and tie off to to keep sterile
Rinse out and dry coolers
Place all cooling packs in a freezer to refreeze
Label consumables (bags and tubes) for next sampling trip
Fill a 50mL tube half full with MgCl
Fill a 50mL tube half full with PFA
Plug in any equipment/batteries that need to charge
Clean and autoclave spatulas/knives if possible (otherwise fresh sets from EMBL)
Make sure all data has been saved and compiled into data sheets 
Cleaning for sediment
Cores, cups, plates, plunger cleaned with 10x diluted bleach 
Put basin of water with small proportion of bleach (~5ml pure bleach)
Rince the spatulas and the cores with water and then place them in a basin (sufficiently large to hold all material, e.g. 60 cm x 1 m x 20 cm in height ) with bleach for 15 minutes
Let them dry or dry them with tissues
Put them in a plastic dark bag (litter bag) to avoid contamination 
Close the bag, and keep it ‘sterile’ until the next sampling 
If possibles alternate cores per TREC site (e.g. 9 cores for Beys de Veys and 9 new cores for Le Havre) 
Rince the core plunger and the shovel (spatula, PVC blade) with normal water. 
Throw away used syringes and prepare new ones for next sampling (or sent them back for autoclave to EMBL)

Field Sampling priority list


	Priority Sampling in general:
Per institutional stop / station, the priority is always to have a complete land to sea transect (= sampling site) rather than reducing samples taken per transect
If a site needs to be dropped, always prioritize to sample the ones that align with TARA sampling
If all samples can’t be taken at the same sampling site decouple as follow
Move water away from sediment and soil transects
Move water and sediment transect away from soil transects
	Priority Sediment:
Reduce to only one sediment transect (at supersites)
Reduce to only the middle triangle (out of the three)
Drop the transect = drop the sampling site
	Priority Soil:
Drop the 3rd transect
Drop the 2nd transect
Drop the transect = drop the samping site

If sample quantities are limited, the priority of soil sub-samples is:
DNA
Organic carbon
Xenobiotics
Dry Chemistry
Inorganic pollution (metals)
Ions
Microscopy
Extra
If sample quantities are limited, the priority of sediment sub-samples is:
DNA

## Protocol

---

### Prepare: 
- TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA) 
- Bead-beater-tubes (with 500 mg+/- 10 mg Zirconia/Silicia beads, autoclaved) 
- 4M Guanidinethiocyanate in 0,1M Tris pH 7,5 (consider appropriate disposal) 
- 5 % N-laurolylsarcosine in PBS (Dulbecco’s phosphate Buffered Saline) (consider appropriate disposal)


### Sample preparation: 
Consider first if you want to use the enzymatic lysis step! 
- For extraction from bacterial culture: Take 2 ml of a well grown culture, centrifuge it at 12.000 x g for 10 min, and discard 
the supernatant 
- For faecal samples stored premixed 1:6 with DNA Stabilizer (recommended for protocol used without enzymatic step): let 
thaw at room temperature. 
- For faecal samples stored without DNA Stabilizer, add DNA stabilizer (1:6) to frozen sample, mix and thaw at room 
temperature  
- If protocol is used with enzymatic step do not use DNA Stabilizer

### DNA Isolation: 
**For enzymatic extraction**
Prepare Lysozyme-Solution (TE Buffer with 15 µg/µl Lysozyme): 
    mass Lysozyme = (#Samples(+1)) * 7.5 mg 
    Volume TE buffer = (#Samples(+1)) * 0.5 ml 
Weigh lysozyme into TE buffer (leave lysozyme stock on ice!) 
1. Resuspend bacterial pellet or faecal sample in 500 µl lysozyme-solution  
2. Incubate for 30 min at 37 °C 
3. Add 50 µl 10 % SDS 
4. Add 15 µl ProteinaseK (20 mg/ml) 
5. Incubate for 1-2 h at 50 °C (liquid should be totally clear) 
Continue with step 2 below 

**Without enzymatic extraction**
For extraction without the enzymatic step, resuspend the bacterial pellet in 600 µl DNA Stool Stabilizer or use 
600µL of faecal sample in DNA stabilizer 
2. Transfer sample into bead-beater-tubes (with 500 mg+/- 10 mg Zirconia/Silicia beads, previously autoclaved)  
3. Add 250 µl 4M Guanidinethiocyanate 
4. Add 500 µl 5 % N-laurolylsarcosine  vortex 
5. Incubate at 70 °C while shaking (700 rpm) for 60 min; Set centrifuge to 4 °C 
6. Bead-beat 3 x with the following program; re-fill the cooling adapter of the bead-beater with dry ice between each 
round:   CY; 40 s; 6,6 m/s, cooled with dry ice
7. Add 15 mg PVPP [Poly(vinylpolypyrrolidone)]  
Vortex, then centrifuge at 15.000 x g, 4 °C, 3 min 
8. Transfer clear supernatant into a new 2 ml tube 
Centrifuge at 15.000 x g, 4 °C, 3 min 
9. Take 500 µl clear supernatant into a new 2 ml tube 
10. Add 5 µl RNase (10 mg/ml), incubate at 37 °C while shaking (700 rpm) for 20-30 min (heat incubator afterwards to 70 °C, 
heat up DE)  
11. Proceed with the NucleoSpin® gDNA Clean-up follow protocol

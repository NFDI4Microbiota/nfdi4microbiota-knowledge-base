A **data repository** is a location where digital objects are stored and documented, and which enable the separate publication and archiving of these objects. Data access can be either open or restricted to a group of users.

## Benefits of publishing data in a repository
---
* **Back-up** (i.e. the practice of keeping additional copies of your research data in a separate physical or cloud locations from your files in storage).
* Increased **data discoverability** and **accessibility**, and thus potential **data reuse**.
* Increased **visibility** and **citations** as repositories can be harvested by **search engines** such as:
    * [BASE](https://www.base-search.net/about/en/index.php)
    * [DataCite Search](https://search.datacite.org/)
    * [Google Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/)
    * [LIVIVO - ZB MED Search Portal for Life Sciences](https://www.livivo.de/)

## Criteria to select a trusted repository
---
Below are listed criteria you might want to consider when selecting a repository where to publish your data:
* Is the repository **certified** according to CoreTrustSeal (CTS), nestor seal/DIN 31644 or ISO 16363? Find these repositories via re3data or the website of various certification initatives:
    * [Find CTS-certified repositories on re3data](https://www.re3data.org/search?query=&certificates%5B%5D=CoreTrustSeal)
    * [Find nestor/DIN 31644-certified repositories on re3data](https://www.re3data.org/search?query=&certificates%5B%5D=DIN%2031644)
    * [Find ISO16363-certified repositories on re3data](https://www.re3data.org/search?query=&certificates%5B%5D=ISO%2016363)
    * [Find a CTS-certified repository on the CTS-Website](https://amt.coretrustseal.org/certificates)
    * [Find a nestor/DIN 31644-certified repository on the nestor-Website](https://www.langzeitarchivierung.de/Webs/nestor/EN/Zertifizierung/nestor_Siegel/siegel.html)
    * [Find an ISO16363-certified repository on the CTAB-Website](http://www.iso16363.org/iso-certification/certified-clients/)
* Is the repository among the repositories preferred by a **funder** and/or endorsed by the **international research community**? In general, community-endorsed repositories should be well known, well-used and have a good continuity plan. If they existed for a long time and contain a lot of published data, their long-term sustainability is likely covered.
* Does the repository provide:
    * **Open Access** to non-sensitive data?
    * The **terms of use** and **licenses** of the data?
    * A **policy** to help researchers determine whether their data needs will be met?
* Does the repository use a Persistent Identifier (PID) system such as assigning a **Digital Object Identifier** (DOI) to submitted datasets?
* Does the repository offer the possibility to integrate all metadata relevant for finding and specifying your publication? 
* Further criteria: costs, repository size, data upload restriction(s), landing pages, guidance on data citation.

## Order of preference for selecting a repository
---
1. A certified resposity (CoreTrustSeal, nestor/DIN 31644, ISO 16363)
2. A well-established repository in your discipline that offers a specific scope (e. g. supporting a specific metadata schema).
3. One of the repositories recommended by your funding organization or the funding program.
4. Your institutionâ€™s repository (if available).
5. A cost-free interdisciplinary repository (e.g. [Figshare](https://figshare.com/), [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)).
6. Another repository that you can search for using the above-mentioned criteria in a repository finder. 

## Well-established repositories for data deposition in microbiology
---
Below are listed well-established repositories in microbiology. For each repository, the FAIRsharing and re3data pages are linked. On the FAIRsharing page, you will find information such as which journals endorse the repository (under "Collections & Recommendations" and then "In Policies"). On the re3data page, you will find information such as the above-mentioned criteria to select a trusted repoository.

* The FRL is **findable** via Google search and indexed in [BASE](https://www.base-search.net/about/en/index.php), [DataCite Search](https://search.datacite.org/) and  [LIVIVO - ZB MED Search Portal for Life Sciences](https://www.livivo.de/).

#### Drawbacks
* The FRL is not suitable for sensitive data.
* The FRL can be browsed only in German.

* **Data guarantee**: availability for the lifetime of the repository
* **Recommended publication formats for research data**: any file format

#### Steps to deposit data in Zenodo 
1.	Upload files.
2.	Describe your content so others can find it.
3.	Publish your content.

For more details, see this [guide](https://www.openaire.eu/zenodo-guide).

* There are **no charges** to publish, archive or use content.
* Zenodo supports the [**FAIR data principles**](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) (e.g. by assigning DOIs).
* Zenodo is **permanently accessible** online.
* Zenodo is indexed in [**re3data**](https://www.re3data.org/repository/r3d100013523).
* Zenodo is **findable** via Google search and indexed in [BASE](https://www.base-search.net/about/en/index.php) and [DataCite Search](https://search.datacite.org/).

#### Drawbacks
* Zenodo might not be suitable for sensitive data that might have to stay in their country of origin.
* Zenodo has a size limit of 50 GB per record. For bigger size, a request has to be made.

## Repository finders
---
* To find any repositories:
    * The DFG-funded registry of research data repositories ([re3data.org](https://www.re3data.org/), [search results](https://www.re3data.org/search?query=Microbiology) for "Microbiology")
    * The RDA-endorsed [FAIRsharing.org](https://fairsharing.org/) ([search results](https://fairsharing.org/search?fairsharingRegistry=Database&subjects=microbiology&page=1) for Databases in Microbiology)

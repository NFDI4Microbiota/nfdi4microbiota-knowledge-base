## Introduction
The guidelines collected here should give prospective trainers an
overview of general (common sense) best practices for executing training
courses. We focus on training events targeted at professionals from the
microbiology field. The points in this guide are partially based on
[Recommendations for Teaching Carpentries Workshops
Online](https://carpentries.org/files/pdf/online-workshop-recommendations.pdf)
by The Carpentries [CC BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) 2020.

There are many different formats for training events, ranging from short
lectures to week-long summer schools. Thus, these general guidelines
will not apply to every single event (format). Feel free to evaluate
each point raised on this page with regards to your planned training
course, and adapt the suggestions listed to your needs.

In general, we give tips and reminders regarding preparation,
communication, and the like. We do not suggest/recommend specific
software or tools. We only mention certain software products to
illustrate our points. We separate the guidelines along the timeline of
before, during, and the training.

## Before the Training

 A large part of the trainer’s work will already be done in preparation
for any training event. Here we list some points that should not be
overlooked when preparing to provide a well-received training event.

### Choose the right format and the right tools
Starting from your training goal, you need to decide what format will best help learners to
attain the expertise you want to impart them with. How much **time** do
you need to adequately teach the topics you intend to? For this question
keep in mind that the learners will not be as quick to grasp the
knowledge you mean to transfer, and not be as fast working on hands-on
exercises, as yourself. Does it make sense to offer this training
**online**, or should this be **on-site**, or even **hybrid**? **How
many participants** can reasonably benefit from your training at once?

Especially online, but also for certain training courses, you will need
to decide on which tools to use, e.g. for communication/presentation
purposes. Generally, you should **use tools you are already familiar
with**. That is, if your institution already uses Zoom or MS Teams to
communicate, Consider using this for online training courses as well.
This will help you and your helpers to be more comfortable with the
technology. Consider what other software/tools you will need to prepare,
or execute, for the training event. You might want to have participants
collaborate in live shared text environments such as Google Docs or
Etherpad, or collaborate on code through GitHub. If you plan to use such
tools but have no prior experience with them, make sure to **familiarize
yourself with the tools** you intend to use.

In addition to being familiar with the software tools, you should also
be familiar with the **“infrastructure” setup**. For example, for an
on-site event, you may want to check that the planned rooms offer
sufficient capacity for the planned number of participants, have no
accessibility concerns, and the beamer works as expected. Make sure,
coffee, drinks, and snacks are organized for breaks and reserve a table
in a restaurant for a “workshop dinner”, if appropriate. Online you
might need to test whether your setup is sufficient. That is, does your
microphone produce a good sound quality and does your setup allow for
what you have planned (E.g. maybe you need an additional monitor). If
you plan to use additional software (like bioinformatic tools) during
the course make sure that they can be used by all participants. For
example you could give detailed installation instructions before the
course, or provide some form of virtual environment (i. e. cloud) or
prepare, at least some, loaner laptops for an onsite training.. Test
data should be easily and downloadable in a reasonable amount of time.
Create some form of documentation that the participants can follow
during and after the course for reference.

### Event Promotion
In order for people to want to join your training
event, they will need to know about your training event. Use what
communication channels you have at your disposal to advertise the
existence of your training opportunity. Make sure to **advertise early**
to give participants time to plan and for word-of-mouth to spread.

You should give prospective training participants a concrete
understanding of what they can expect of your training event. Your event
description should **clearly list the learning goals**, so that
potential trainees know what benefit the course will bring to them. You
should **list the requirements** **for the target audience** for your
training event. That is, is this open to everybody, only open to
students and/or staff of a particular institution, or something else?
You should detail any prerequisites, such as particular skill levels in
a given programming language, the prospective participants should
already have to successfully participate in the course.

Finally, you should also make clear what format the training will have.
You do not have to provide a detailed program/schedule at this stage,
but participants will need to know where the course is held, **online**
or at which **on-site** location, and what **times/dates** the training
will take place.

### Get help(ers)
Most training formats work better when not being
carried out by a single person. For example, one person may present the
content while another helps struggling trainees with installing
software. Or in an online setting, one person may talk and present,
while another monitors and responds/reacts to chat.

For hands-on sessions it is also advisable to have more than one person
offering assistance, such that not one group or person can capitalize on
the trainer’s time.

In preparation for the training event, all trainers/helpers should meet
and **discuss what each person’s role is** (in preparing the event and
in carrying out the event).

### Contact the Participants
About a week before the training event starts (depending on your
format possibly earlier), you might want to contact
the people that registered to remind them of your training event and
provide additional detail/info. When communicating with a larger group
of people, possibly from different institutions, via email, do not put
the full list of your participants email addresses in the visible *to*
or *cc* fields. Instead, set up a **mailing list**, or set the email
addresses on ***bcc***. Do **provide your preferred contact details**,
such as email address, and that of your helpers to the participants too.
They might need a way to communicate with you and your helpers in
preparation for the training.

Depending on the event format, especially for on-site events, it might
be necessary to educate the participants with regards to the logistics
of the training event. **Where** do they need to go? For out of city
participants, **how to best get there**? You might hang up flyers in the
building to guid the participants to the training room. What is the
program/**timeline** for the training event? If there are
**accessibility issues**, mentioning them now gives people the chance to
respond and enquire about solutions.

At this point you should also explain to the future participants, what
tools will be used during the training course and critically, **what tools need to already be installed**, ready to go, for the training to
start on day one without delay. This again includes installing
communication tools (if needed), or needing to be registered to
platforms such as GitHub. This can also include more specific tools such
as having the latest version of Python or some bioinformatics software
installed. Do not forget that this kind of information also needs to be
passed on to last minute registrations that may occur after you sent out
the original notification. Even having given detailed instructions to
future participants regarding required software, you should not expect
all people to successfully comply with this. It is a good idea to
schedule some time for technical problems at the beginning of the course
and **plan for a fallback** in case some participants are unable to
install certain required software elements. For example, most
communication tools such as Zoom offer participants to join a call
through a web browser. Ideally you would also give the participants a
contact person who is able and willing to assist with software issues in
preparation for the event.

### Plan the content/structure
When preparing the content/structure of
the training course/event, there are a few points you may want to
consider. To not overwhelm the trainees, split the training into
**multiple shorter intervals/sessions**. Each session should be limited
to no more than 90 minutes. There should be a good **balance between teaching presentations and hands-on exercises**. Even during the
teaching sessions, especially online, you may plan to **encourage
audience participation** by periodically involving the trainees in short
(anonymous) surveys or quizzes, show of hands, or similar. This can not
only lead to a better engagement with the listeners, but also allows you
the opportunity to evaluate whether the content you mean to teach is
understood and/or your pacing is correct.

When planning the time-slots, you need to realize that trainees will
need more time to work on hands-on exercises than you yourself would.
Similarly, do not underestimate the time it takes to teach new content
during teaching sessions. Generally, when it comes to teaching content,
**value is more important than volume**. That is, it is often not a good
idea to try to cover too much new content, but better to be clear and
repeat key points to cement the understanding of the learners. Your
teaching content should improve the understanding of the relevant topics
and enable the trainees to independently solve the hands-on exercises.

You should already **plan for optional content that can be dropped**
from the curriculum in case the training progresses slower than
anticipated. You do not want to realize that there is not sufficient
time for all your content and have only crucial information left to
teach. So, know beforehand what content to skip.

When preparing **training materials**, you should consider to **follow the FAIR principles**, i.e. make your material easily accessible for
other researchers. For example, you could use github for a documentation
on your hands-on session, that can be read, reused and extended by
everyone. A good introduction is given in “[Ten simple rules for making
training materials
FAIR](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007854)”.



## During the Training

### Arrival
Before the first session of your training event you should
aim to **be 10-15 min early** at the facilities (on-site) or online.
This will give you time to finish your setup (e.g. connecting to the
beamer on-site) or to recognize, and hopefully fix, technical issues
(e.g. a missing link for an online meeting), as well as greet the
attendees.

### Introduction
Before you begin presenting the actual content you mean
to impart on your trainees, **introduce the training team** (i.e.
yourself but also any helpers) involved in the meeting. This will allow
the attendees to recognize contact persons for questions that might
arise. You could also start with a short introduction round where every
participant and teacher explains his background and previous knowledge
on the course topic. This might also give you an idea on what points of
the program you should focus on and who might need more assistance.

Along with any other information that you deem useful, **introduce the
planned program** to the attendees and on when the next break is
scheduled. You should also already **give an overview of the learning
goals**, such that participants know what to expect.

In general, be mindful of your language. E.g. **be respectful and
inclusive** when addressing the participants, helpers, and other
entities. Make sure to **address the audience**. On-site, this may mean
turning towards them instead of speaking towards the
blackboard/whiteboard. Online this may mean turning on your camera, even
if not required for the participants.

Use the introduction to **establish how to ask questions** and make
comments. E.g. Should participants ask immediately, or wait for the end
of a topic/session? Online, should they raise their hand or ask
questions in chat such that other people, e.g. helpers, can answer or
bring the question to the forefront? When answering questions, it is a
good idea to **repeat the question** you are responding to, so everybody
is on the same page with regards to what is actually answered and how
you understood the question. Also, there are undoubtably stupid
questions. However, keep the point from above in mind and be mindful of
your language. Thus, when it comes to your training event participants,
there are no stupid questions. Some questions that are not of broad
interest to most participants can be deferred to a more appropriate
time, such as a chat during the next scheduled break.

Also **be mindful of privacy issues** and the related legal questions
during your training event. Legal advice is beyond the scope of this
resource, but do consider what rules/laws apply to your jurisdiction
e.g. regarding taking (online) recordings of the event, taking pictures
and publishing them, e.g., on social media, or for requiring
participants to write down their names/email addresses or similar in
shared documents.

### Presentations
The presentations should be kept **relevant to the
topic** and further the understanding of the learning goals. They should
enable the listeners to work on any following hands-on exercises
independently. It is a good idea for each session to **start with an
overview** of what topic you are going to cover.

When presenting content with slides, make sure to **keep the content
simple** and easy to grasp. That is, avoid long walls of text or
complicated formulas. **Attribute figures and references** you include
in your teaching materials correctly. Important information that
participants need to retain, such as your contact details/email/number,
and/or links to installation guides for the hands-on exercises, should
not only be available/visible for a short duration during a slide show.
**Make important information accessible to the trainees** at all times.
E.g. by uploading the slides, or just the relevant information to
repositories accessible to the trainees, or handing out printed teaching
materials.

**Limit the passive (screen-)time** trainees are exposed to. In addition
to planning hands-on exercises, your online teaching segments may be
enriched by occasionally asking for audience participation (e.g. via
(anonymous) polls, quizzes, shows of hands, etc.) that can also help you
to gauge how well your learning goals were achieved, and/or live
examples (e.g. live-coding, or tool demonstrations). When doing a live
demonstration, be sure to **explain clearly what you are going to do
beforehand**, and again **in more detail during** your demonstration.
You might also **review what you did** after. Allow for **short pauses
in your workflow** for the listener to digest what you are doing. E.g.
for a live demonstration of a command line tool, explain why you set the
options/flags you did, and wait a second before pressing enter once the
command is fully typed.

### Breaks
Allow for frequent breaks. New information can quickly
overwhelm learners and breaks help to alleviate this. Further, breaks
offer a good transition point from one topic to another, or one activity
to another (e.g. switching between teaching and hands-on exercises).
Breaks also offer the participants an opportunity to refresh themselves
or socialize. When the break starts, **expect questions/discussions** to
be directed at the training team. Thus, if possible, the people in the
training team should not immediately disappear as soon as the break (for
the participants) starts. In order to facilitate a seamless training
environment, **communicate breaks clearly**. That is, when can the
participants expect breaks, and when will the training event resume
afterwards. When the time for a scheduled break comes, make sure that
you **do not go over time**. Participants, especially online, may have
made plans around that schedule.

### Hands-On Exercises
Depending on the format and topic of the training
event, hands-on exercises are great for engaging the trainees and
reinforcing their understanding of the material. You should aim to
**find a good balance** between teaching presentations and hands-on
exercises. The instructions in preparation for the hands-on sections
should be simple and easy to understand such that the trainees can work
on the problems independently, or in groups. Nonetheless, the training
team should be prepared to **support struggling participants** during
the hands-on segments by answering questions, giving technical support,
or feedback. As during the presentation part of the training, you should
make it clear to the participants **how to ask for support**. You may
also proactively ask the teams/individuals how they are doing and
whether assistance is needed.

### Closure
At the end of your training event, you should **give an
overview/summary** of the achieved learning goals from the introduction.

You should make sure that you **do not go over time**. The trainees have
likely received a lot of input during the training event, which can be
mentally taxing. They may also have made plans or travel arrangements
for after the event. You should already have planned what content to
drop without losing too much value beforehand, such that the schedule
can be realized.

Do **run a feedback survey** to evaluate whether the participants
enjoyed and valued the course and/or what can be done to improve the
training in the future. Do try to ensure that the feedback can be
anonymous and that the question can highlight points of improvement to
enable you/the team to provide an even better experience the next time.



## After the event
Shortly after the event, you should  **meet with all trainers** involved
and **gather their feedback**. Collect points that should be improved
for the next course of this kind and document them in an appropriate
way, so that you find them quickly for the next time. Also evaluate
important points from the feedback survey once you have the results.

Finally, you should consider to **share any teaching materials**
(slides, recordings, etc.) you can with the former participants. This
can be done via email, shared repositories, or dedicated platforms and
should be easy if you followed the FAIR principles during the
preparation. The goal is to enable the participants to look up, or
reflect upon, certain topics they may want to internalize or refresh for
themselves, as well as look up details for methods they may have
learned/been exposed to during the event. You are also encouraged to
**share the teaching materials with other trainers** such that they can
benefit from the work you already provided. If you do so, make sure to
state under what license you provide your work. We suggest a permissive
license such as [CC BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), or „CC 0“.

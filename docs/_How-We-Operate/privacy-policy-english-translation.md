## § 9 Social media


### Use of social media buttons 

1. We currently use the following social media buttons via “c't Shariff”: Youtube, Flickr, Google+, Twitter, Xing, LinkedIn. The c't Shariff project replaces the usual social network share buttons and protects your surfing behavior from prying eyes. Nevertheless, a single click on the button is enough to share information with others. The usual social media buttons transmit user data to Facebook & Co. every time you visit a page and provide the social networks with precise information about your surfing behavior (user tracking). You do not need to be logged in or a member of the network to do this. In contrast, a Shariff button only establishes direct contact between the social network and the visitor when the latter actively clicks on the share button. In this way, Shariff prevents you from leaving a digital trail on every page you visit. Thanks to Shariff, the display of “likes”, “+1s” or “tweets” comes from the operator of the page with the buttons. Shariff acts as an intermediate instance here: Instead of the browser, the website operator's server queries the number of “likes”, “+1s” or “tweets” - and only once a minute to keep traffic within limits. The visitor remains anonymous. Further information on “c't Shariff” can be found at: https://www.heise.de/ct/artikel/Shariff-Social-Media-Buttons-mit-Datenschutz-2467514.html.

2. Address of the respective button provider and URL with its data protection information: Heise Medien GmbH & Co. KG, Karl-Wiechert-Allee 10, 30625 Hanover, Germany; https://www.heise.de/Privacy-Policy-der-Heise-Medien-GmbH-Co-KG-4860.html.

### Integration of YouTube videos 

1. We have integrated YouTube videos into our online offering, which are stored on http://www.YouTube.com and can be played directly from our website. These are all integrated in “extended data protection mode”, i.e. no data about you as a user is transferred to YouTube if you do not play the videos. Only when you play the videos will the data mentioned in paragraph 2 be transmitted. We have no influence on this data transfer. 

2. By visiting the website, YouTube receives the information that you have accessed the corresponding subpage of our website. In addition, the data mentioned under § 3 of this declaration will be transmitted. This occurs regardless of whether YouTube provides a user account through which you are logged in or whether no user account exists. If you are logged in to Google, your data will be assigned directly to your account. If you do not wish your data to be associated with your YouTube profile, you must log out before activating the button. YouTube stores your data as usage profiles and uses them for the purposes of advertising, market research and/or the needs-based design of its website. Such an evaluation is carried out in particular (even for users who are not logged in) to provide needs-based advertising and to inform other users of the social network about your activities on our website. You have the right to object to the creation of these user profiles, whereby you must contact YouTube to exercise this right. 

3. Further information on the purpose and scope of data collection and its processing by YouTube can be found in YouTube's privacy policy. There you will also find further information on your rights and setting options to protect your privacy: https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy. Google also processes your personal data in the USA and has submitted to the EU-US Privacy Shield, https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework.

### Integration of Google Maps 

1. We use the Google Maps service on our website www.zbmed.de. This allows us to show you interactive maps directly on the website and enables you to use the map function conveniently. 

2. When you visit the website, Google receives the information that you have accessed the corresponding subpage of our website. In addition, the data mentioned under § 3 of this declaration will be transmitted. This takes place regardless of whether Google provides a user account through which you are logged in or whether no user account exists. If you are logged in to Google, your data will be assigned directly to your account. If you do not wish your data to be associated with your Google profile, you must log out before activating the button. Google stores your data as usage profiles and uses them for the purposes of advertising, market research and/or the needs-based design of its website. Such an evaluation is carried out in particular (even for users who are not logged in) to provide needs-based advertising and to inform other users of the social network about your activities on our website. You have the right to object to the creation of these user profiles, whereby you must contact Google to exercise this right. 

3. Further information on the purpose and scope of data collection and its processing by the plug-in provider can be found in the provider's privacy policy. There you will also find further information on your rights in this regard and setting options to protect your privacy: http://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy. Google also processes your personal data in the USA and has submitted to the EU-US Privacy Shield, https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework.

## § 10 Online advertising


### Use of Google Adwords Conversion6 

1. At www.zbmed.de, www.publisso.de and www.livivo.de, we use Google Adwords to draw attention to our offers with the help of advertising material (so-called Google Adwords) on external websites. In relation to the advertising campaign data, we can determine how successful the individual advertising measures are. We are interested in showing you advertising that is of interest to you, making our website more interesting for you and achieving a fair calculation of advertising costs. 

2. These advertising materials are delivered by Google via so-called “ad servers”. For this purpose, we use ad server cookies, through which certain parameters for measuring success, such as the display of ads or clicks by users, can be measured. If you access our website via a Google ad, Google Adwords will store a cookie on your PC. This cookie generally loses its validity after 30 days and is not intended to identify you personally. The unique cookie ID, number of ad impressions per placement (frequency), last impression (re-relevant for post-view conversions) and opt-out information (marking that the user no longer wishes to be addressed) are usually stored as analysis values for this cookie. 

3. These cookies enable Google to recognize your internet browser. If a user visits certain pages of an Adwords customer's website and the cookie stored on their computer has not yet expired, Google and the customer can recognize that the user clicked on the ad and was redirected to this page. A different cookie is assigned to each Adwords customer. Cookies can therefore not be tracked via the websites of Adwords customers. We ourselves do not collect and process any personal data in the aforementioned advertising measures. We only receive statistical evaluations from Google. Based on these evaluations, we can recognize which of the advertising measures used are particularly effective. We do not receive any further data from the use of the advertising material; in particular, we cannot identify the users on the basis of this information.

4. Due to the marketing tools used, your browser automatically establishes a direct connection with the Google server. We have no influence on the scope and further use of the data collected by Google through the use of this tool and therefore inform you according to our state of knowledge: Through the integration of AdWords Conversion, Google receives the information that you have accessed the corresponding part of our website or clicked on an advertisement from us. If you are registered with a Google service, Google can assign the visit to your account. Even if you are not registered with Google or have not logged in, it is possible that the provider will find out your IP address and store it. 

5. You can prevent participation in this tracking process in various ways: 
  
    a. by setting your browser software accordingly, in particular by suppressing third-party cookies so that you do not receive any ads from third-party providers; 
  
    b. by deactivating cookies for conversion tracking by setting your browser to block cookies from the domain www.googleadservices.com, https://www.google.de/settings/ads, whereby this setting will be deleted if you delete your cookies; 
  
    c. by deactivating the interest-based ads of the providers that are part of the “About Ads” self-regulation campaign via the link http://www.aboutads.info/choices, whereby this setting will be deleted if you delete your cookies; 
  
    d. by permanently deactivating them in your Firefox, Internet Explorer or Google Chrome browsers under the link http://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin. We would like to point out that in this case you may not be able to use all functions of this website to their full extent. 
  
6. The legal basis for the processing of your data is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR. Further information on data protection at Google can be found here: http://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy and https://services.google.com/sitestats/de.html. Alternatively, you can visit the website of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) at http://www.networkadvertising.org. Google has submitted to the EU-US Privacy Shield, https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework.

    Google Remarketing In addition to Adwords Conversion, we use the Google Remarketing application on www.zbmed.de, www.publisso.de and www.livivo.de. This is a procedure with which we would like to address you again. This application allows our advertisements to be displayed to you when you continue to use the Internet after visiting our website. This is done by means of cookies stored in your browser, which are used by Google to record and evaluate your usage behavior when you visit various websites. This enables Google to determine your previous visit to our website. According to its own statements, Google does not merge the data collected in the context of remarketing with your personal data, which may be stored by Google. In particular, according to Google, pseudonymization is used in remarketing.

### DoubleClick by Google8 

1. On www.zbmed.de, www.publisso.de and www.livivo.de we continue to use the online marketing tool DoubleClick by Google. DoubleClick uses cookies to display ads that are relevant to users, to improve campaign performance reports or to prevent a user from seeing the same ads more than once. Google uses a cookie ID to record which ads are displayed in which browser and can thus prevent them from being displayed more than once. In addition, DoubleClick can use cookie IDs to record so-called conversions that are related to ad requests. This is the case, for example, when a user sees a DoubleClick ad and later visits the advertiser's website with the same browser and makes a purchase there. According to Google, DoubleClick cookies do not contain any personal information.

2. Due to the marketing tools used, your browser automatically establishes a direct connection with the Google server. We have no influence on the scope and further use of the data collected by Google through the use of this tool and therefore inform you according to our state of knowledge: Through the integration of DoubleClick, Google receives the information that you have called up the corresponding part of our website or clicked on an advertisement from us. If you are registered with a Google service, Google can assign the visit to your account. Even if you are not registered with Google or have not logged in, there is a possibility that the provider will find out your IP address and store it.

3. You can prevent participation in this tracking process in various ways:
  
    a. by setting your browser software accordingly, in particular by suppressing third-party cookies so that you do not receive ads from third-party providers;
   
    b. by deactivating cookies for conversion tracking by setting your browser to block cookies from the domain www.googleadservices.com, https://www.google.de/settings/ads, whereby this setting will be deleted if you delete your cookies;
   
    c. by deactivating the interest-based ads of the providers that are part of the “About Ads” self-regulation campaign via the link http://www.aboutads.info/choices, whereby this setting will be deleted if you delete your cookies;

    d. by permanently deactivating them in your Firefox, Internet Explorer or Google Chrome browsers via the link http://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin. We would like to point out that in this case you may not be able to use all the functions of this website to their full extent.

4. The legal basis for the processing of your data is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR. Further information on DoubleClick by Google can be found at https://www.google.de/doubleclick and https://support.google.com/campaignmanager/answer/2839090, as well as on data protection at Google in general: https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy.

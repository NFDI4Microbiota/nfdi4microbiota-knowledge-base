# Microbial Isolates from Mammalian Hosts

In addition to the direct analysis of microbial ecosystems using molecular techniques, cultivation-based approaches are very important for microbiota research 
The isolation and characterization of strains make it possible to describe novel taxonomic and functional diversity, define the mechanisms underlying microbe- microbe and microbe- host interactions, and open avenues for biotechnological and clinical applications.
Working with isolates generates a lot of technical, environmental, and biological data and metadata that must be taken care of according to the [FAIR principles](/Research-Data-Management/04-fair).
Moreover, the use of isolates must adhere to the [Nagoya Protocol](https://www.cbd.int/abs/about). With NFDI4Microbiota, the [University Hospital of RWTH](https://www.ukaachen.de/kliniken-institute/institut-fuer-medizinische-mikrobiologie/forschung/ag-clavel/our-research/)
[Aachen](https://www.ukaachen.de/kliniken-institute/institut-fuer-medizinische-mikrobiologie/forschung/ag-clavel/our-research/) and the [Leibniz Institute DSMZ](https://www.dsmz.de/) generate public collections of bacterial isolates from the intestine of human and animals to help the community. The naming of novel bacteria improves the resolution of microbiota analysis by high-throughput molecular methods, and researchers can use the isolates for their own experiments, enabling further progress in the field.

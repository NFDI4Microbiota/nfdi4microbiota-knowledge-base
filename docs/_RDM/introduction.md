## Research data

### Definition of research data
Research data is "any information collected, stored, and processed to produce and validate original research results" [DeWitt Wallace Library](https://libguides.macalester.edu/data1). There is no consensus on the definition, the definition varies depending on disciplines and research funders. 

### Common data types in microbiology
Data types in microbiology include the following:
* High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) data also known as Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data such as:
  * Genomics (DNA-Seq) and metagenomics data
  * Expression data (RNA-Seq)
  * Specific procotols such as CLIP-Seq, HiC, RIP-Seq, RIL-Seq, Ribo-Seq
* Proteomics
* Metabolomics
* Crystallographic data
* Gene expression data from microarrays
* Geospatial data
* Image data
* Linked Open Data (LOD)
* Macromolecular structures
* Phenotypic data
* Quantitative microbiological data
* Semantic data
* Scientific texts
* Species interaction data (e.g. physical microbial interaction data)

### Common research data registries
Databases and data repositories in microbiology can be found in the two following registries:
* [re3data.org](https://www.re3data.org/) ([search results](https://www.re3data.org/search?query=Microbiology) for "Microbiology")
* [FAIRsharing.org](https://fairsharing.org/) ([search results](https://fairsharing.org/search?fairsharingRegistry=Database&subjects=microbiology&page=1) for Databases in Microbiology)

### Common data formats in microbiology
Common data formats for various data types are listed below (in bold are formats suitable for digital preservation) ([PUBLISSO](https://www.publisso.de/en/research-data-management/rd-archiving/)):
* Biomaterial data
    * **CSV (.csv)**
    * FASTA (.fasta)
    * FASTQ (.fq, .fastq)
    * PDB (.pdb, .ent, .brk)
    * **TXT (.txt)**
    * XLS (.xls)
    * **XML (.xml)**
* Geospatial data
    * ESRI Shapefiles (.shp)
    * **GML (.gml)**

    * MapInfo (.tab)
    * **MID (.mid)**
    * **MIF (.mif)**
* Image data

    * **TXT Unicode (.txt, .asc, .c, .h, .cpp, .m, .py etc. in ASCII format)**
    * **XML (.xml)**

## Research data life cycle

The research data life cycle is the process that includes all methods and procedures along a research project ([PUBLISSO](https://www.publisso.de/en/research-data-management/)). The cycle usually follows these steps:
* Planning
* Data Collection
* Data Processing & Analysis
* Data Sharing & Publishing
* Digital Preservation
* Data Discovery & Reuse

Below is a representation of this cycle:

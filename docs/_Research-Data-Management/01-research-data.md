# Definition of research data
Research data is "any information collected, stored, and processed to produce and validate original research results" [[DeWitt Wallace Library](https://libguides.macalester.edu/data1)]. There is no consensus on the definition, the definition varies depending on disciplines and research funders. 

# Common data types in microbiology
Data types in microbiology include the following:
* Crystallographic data
* Geospatial data
* Image data
* Linked genotype and phenotype data
* Linked Open Data (LOD)
* Macromolecular structures (e.g. electron microscopy data)
* Microbiome data (e.g. physical microbiome interactions)
* Nucleic acid sequences (raw seqeuncing data (reads or traces), genome assemblies, annotated sequences, sample metadata) such as:
  * DNA sequences
    * (Meta)genomes
    * Genetic polymorphism
    * Genomic features
    * Genomic organization
  * RNA sequences
    * 16S ribosomal RNA sequences
    * Functional genomics / gene expression data (e.g. ribosome profiling)
    * RNA-protein interactions
    * Small RNA (sRNA)
    * Transcriptomics
* Protein sequences
  * Protein-protein interactions
  * Proteomes
* Quantitative and predictive food microbiology
* Scientific texts
* Semantic data
* Species interaction data (e.g. physical microbial interaction data)
* Standardized bacterial information
* Vertebrate-virus network

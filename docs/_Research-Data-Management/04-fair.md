# Introduction

The FAIR data principles are a concise and measurable set of principles that may act as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data holdings. FAIR stands for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable {% cite wilkinson_2016  %}. The FAIR data principles aims at {% cite wilkinson_2016 lowenberg_2021 %}:

* Improving the infrastructure supporting the reuse of scholarly data.
* Enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use data.
* Supporting the reuse of data by individuals, which “is essential to the advancement of research and clinical practice”.

The principles {% cite wilkinson_2016 go_fair_2022 %} are reproduced below:

## To be Findable

* (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier.
* Data are described with rich metadata.
* Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data it describes.
* (Meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource (e.g. data repository).

# To be Accessible

* (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardized communications protocol (e.g. http(s)).
* The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable.
* The protocol allows for an authentication and authorization procedure, where necessary.
* Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available.

# To be Interoperable 

Data interoperability is the ability of a dataset to work with other datasets or systems without special effort on the part of the user {% cite godan_action_2019_3588148 %}.

* (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation (e.g. controlled vocabularies/ontologies/thesauri, a good data model).
* (Meta)data use vocabularies that follow the FAIR principles (e.g. using FAIR Data Point).
* (Meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data (e.g. specifying if one dataset builds on another one, properly citing all datasets).

# To be Reusable

* Meta(data) are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes (i.e. metadata that richly describes the context under which the data was generated such as the experimental protocols, the species used).
* (Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license.
* (Meta)data are associated with detailed provenance.

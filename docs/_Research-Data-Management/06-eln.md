# Introduction
Electronic Lab Notebooks (ELNs) are software meant to document experiments and research data. They act as a replacement for paper lab notebooks in the context of the digital transformation. ELNs include features such as protocol templates, collaboration tools, support for electronic signatures and the ability to manage the lab inventory.

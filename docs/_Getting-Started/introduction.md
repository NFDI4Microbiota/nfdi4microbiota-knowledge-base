## NFDI4Microbiota - <small class="text-muted">Democratize access to microbiota data and high-end computational analyses</small>


NFDI4Microbiota is a consortium that is part of the German NFDI (National research Data Infrastructure), aimed at advancing microbiological research through digital transformation. 

### Mission

Our mission is to be the central hub in Germany for supporting the microbiology community with access to (meta)data, analysis services, data/metadata standards, training and infrastructure. Given microbiology's relevance to medicine, agriculture, biotechnology, and earth sciences, the consortium's work strives for a broader societal impact.

### Vision

The vision of the NFDI4Microbiota consortium is that researchers in microbiology (including bacteriology, virology, protistology, mycology and parasitology) can translate research data easily into a deep understanding of microbial species and their interactions on a molecular level.

### What we aim and strive for 

We aim to foster a cultural shift towards open science and reproducible research by promoting the FAIR principles, that are, Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable research. We offer training to enhance researchers' skills and data literacy, thereby improving the overall quality of research. By integrating microbial expertise, we aim to augment the value of other NFDI consortia and strengthen connections within the national and international microbiology communities.

We strive to improve research processes by organizing and linking microbial (meta)data, supporting high-quality (meta)data management through data stewards, and enhancing (meta)data reproducibility through standardized processing and analysis. Additionally, we are developing computational tools to translate (meta)data into new insights and creating a central information hub tailored to the needs of the microbial research community.

### Where to find us

The following data is compiled from a questionnaire of Q4 2022 and is targeted at groups funded under NFDI4Microbiota, that have a particular application/pipeline/database (henceforth referred to just as "tool") already implemented or in inception that should be integrated and endorsed by the NFDI4Microbiota umbrella.

The goal is to gather this information centrally in NFDI4Microbiota to assess the span of tools and derive consortium-wide guidelines for the tightest integration possible.

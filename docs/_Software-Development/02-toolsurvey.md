The following data is compiled from a questionnaire of Q4 2022 and is targeted at groups funded under NFDI4Microbiota, that have a particular application/pipeline/database (henceforth referred to just as "tool") already implemented or in inception that should be integrated and endorsed by the NFDI4Microbiota umbrella.

The goal is to gather this information centrally in NFDI4Microbiota to assess the span of tools and derive consortium-wide guidelines for the tightest integration possible.

## Disclaimer: Changes in the tool display

We recently created a [NFDI4Microbiota domain](https://bio.tools/t?domain=nfdi4microbiota) on [the life sciences software registry bio.tools](https://bio.tools) and we will soon be displaying all the tools that NFDI4Microbiota created as well as the ones that NFDI4Microbiota consortium members endorse and highly recommend.

Thank you for your patience while we sort out editing rights and collection labels.  
In the meantime, browse our tools below and find more [recommendations for resources on reproducible data analysis](https://nfdi4microbiota.github.io/nfdi4microbiota-knowledge-base/Reproducible-Data-Analysis/04-resources).

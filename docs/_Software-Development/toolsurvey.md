The following data is compiled from a questionnaire of Q4 2022 and is targeted at groups funded under NFDI4Microbiota, that have a particular application/pipeline/database (henceforth referred to just as "tool") already implemented or in inception that should be integrated and endorsed by the NFDI4Microbiota umbrella.

The goal is to gather this information centrally in NFDI4Microbiota to assess the span of tools and derive consortium-wide guidelines for the tightest integration possible.

## Disclaimer: Changes in the tool display
---
We recently created a [NFDI4Microbiota domain](https://bio.tools/t?domain=nfdi4microbiota) on [the life sciences software registry bio.tools](https://bio.tools) and we will soon be displaying all the tools that NFDI4Microbiota created as well as the ones that NFDI4Microbiota consortium members endorse and highly recommend.

Thank you for your patience while we sort out editing rights and collection labels.  
In the meantime, browse our tools below and find more [recommendations for resources on reproducible data analysis]({% link _Reproducible-Data-Analysis/resources.md %}).

### The Cloud-based Workflow Manager - CloWM (BIBI)
The Cloud-based Workflow Manager (CloWM /klaʊm/) offers the seamless integration of (1) curated, scientific workflows written in the Nextflow DSL, (2) robust data storage, (3) a highly scalable compute layer for data-intensive analysis tasks and a (4) user-friendly interface. The CloWM platform is completely open-source and can be used free-of-charge.
The CloWM platform already contains several curated, best-practice workflows that cover a broad range of research fields/tasks, such as metagenomics (WGS and 16S), human-variation-analysis, infectious diseases (SARS-CoV2, Mpox, Influenza A+B), meta-barcoding, genome assembly, transcriptomics, basecalling, phylogenomics, …
Some of these workflows are exclusively available on CloWM.

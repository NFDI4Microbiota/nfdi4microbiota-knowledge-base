General Protein Storage {% cite Protein_purification_Protein_Expression_and_Purification_Core_Facility %}:
For short-term storage (~24h), most proteins can be kept at 4°C. For long-term storage, protein samples are typically kept at -20°C or -80°C. 
Protein storage at -20°C usually requires the addition of 50% glycerol to your sample to avoid freezing at this temperature. If we plan to store a protein at -20°C, we generally run the final size exclusion chromatography step in 2x storage buffer and then dilute the sample 1:1 with 100% glycerol. Alternatively, the protein sample can also be dialysed against the storage buffer already containing 50% glycerol. Proteins stored at -20ºC are often stable for several months, although the exact time frame is protein-dependent and should be determined experimentally. 
Protein samples stored at -80ºC will be frozen. As repeated freeze-thaw cycles usually have a negative influence on protein samples, it is best to prepare small-sized, single-use aliquots that will be used up during the course of an experiment. 5-10% glycerol or other additives that protect against the effect of freezing and thawing can be added as well. After preparing your protein sample aliquots, it is important to flash-freeze them in liquid nitrogen before importing them into the -80ºC freezer for long-term storage. Many proteins are stable for months to years when stored under appropriate conditions at -80°C, but the exact time frame varies from protein to protein and should be determined experimentally.

| Stool samples                    | samples were self-collected using collection tubes specific for faecal material (Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany). Toilet paper was placed at the bottom of the WC, to prevent stool samples from sinking and getting contaminated.
